A harsh glare flooded the apartment as police floodlights carved sharp silhouettes into the smog-heavy alley below.

Her heart thudded like it knew more than she did. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\nA buzz echoed through the apartment; her front door. Insistent. Mechanical.\n\nAsh grabbed her jacket from the chair, shrugging it on with muscle memory. As she padded toward the door, her eyes flicked to the digital viewer.

We need to talk.\u201d\n\nShe froze.\n\nMendez? With spotlights and boots?\n\nBefore she could answer, a floorboard creaked behind her. She turned.\n\nRiley.

The last moral compass in a machine built without one. He\u2019d been the only one willing to say Helix had gone too far.\n\nNow he was dead.

I didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey found your prints,\u201d Riley continued. \u201cOn the scene. On the weapon.\u201d\n\nAsh\u2019s stomach dropped. Her vision narrowed, sharp and hollow.\n\nHenshaw hadn\u2019t just known secrets; he was one.\n\nMendez\u2019s voice again, harder now: \u201cAsh, don\u2019t make this worse. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to Riley, voice ice-cold. \u201cWas there actually a Tram strike last night?\u201d\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe I could talk to you before\u2026 before anyone else did. I didn\u2019t even believe it, and I especially didn\u2019t think they\u2019d come this fast.\u201d\n\nAsh didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYou left OmniCore late, showed up at my place without warning, crashed on my couch, and now you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m wanted for murder?\u201d\n\nRiley met her stare; but only for a second. His jaw clenched. \u201cIf you run, they\u2019ll make you look guilty.\u201d\n\nShe backed away, toward the window. \u201cIf I stay, they\u2019ll make me disappear.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d spent her career chasing ghosts for OmniCore.

No one had this number except one person she hadn\u2019t heard from in over a year.\n\nRamon.\n\nShe answered. \u201cThis better be good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsh.\u201d His voice was low, urgent. \u201cThey\u2019ve buried the truth. Whatever you\u2019re seeing on the surface? It\u2019s deeper. They\u2019ve already labeled you dirty.\u201d\n\nHer jaw clenched. \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen the internal flags. You're compromised in their system. If you stay, they\u2019ll make sure you never resurface.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what; you're just helping out of the goodness of your heart now?\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m paying back an old debt. There\u2019s a tunnel; old utility access beneath the market district. It\u2019s off the grid. Quiet.\u201d\n\nAsh moved, muscle memory kicking in. Gun holstered. Jacket on. Her world was collapsing in reverse; ally by ally, truth by truth.\n\n\u201cSend the coordinates,\u201d she said.\n\nHe did.\n\nTen minutes later, Ash stood beneath a flickering neon sign, the entrance to the tunnel looming like a mouth carved from concrete and regret. The city behind her pulsed with unseen threats. The tunnel promised something different; answers, maybe. Or at least a head start.\n\n(link: \"We've come this far, no point in stopping now.\")"

A few sparks later, the chain clattered loose.\n\nThey slipped inside.\n\nThe substation was dark, save for the blinking light of a standby console deep in the basement stairwell. Ash reached the wall panel, pulled Mendez\u2019s clearance code from memory, and keyed in the sequence. A low whirr, a hiss of shifting servos; then the hatch cracked open.\n\nShe moved first.\n\nThe air inside was sharp and dry, laced with rust and ozone. Her footfalls softened as they reached the bottom. Shelving units loomed like forgotten skeletons, and in the far corner, a jury-rigged terminal glowed faintly; cobbled together from scavenged field tech, still pulsing with narrowband power.\n\nAsh crossed the floor, eyes narrowed.\n\nCipher was already beside the unit, running a diagnostic from a handheld deck. \u201cThis is clean work,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNot a trap. A message.\u201d\n\nMendez hung back, near the door. Watching.\n\nAsh leaned in. The screen scrolled slowly; manual uplink traces, beacon routing, and one flagged packet: a data spike bouncing from the precinct node to a location in the Arcadia District. Arcadia Tower. 26th floor.\n\nShe pulled the log up again. No other pings. No redundancies.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t sent in panic,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberate.\u201d\n\nCipher nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s pointing us somewhere. Could be a backdoor into Sigma.\u201d\n\nMendez stepped forward now, voice low. \u201cOr a breadcrumb meant to get you out in the open. His apartment\u2019s not far from here. If he\u2019s still alive\u2026 you might find something real. Or at least personal.\u201d\n\nAsh stared at the blinking trace. It pulsed. Not frantic. Not decayed.\n\nSteady. Intentional.\n\n(link: \"Go to his apartment and look for him. This lead feels like a trap.\")"

Inside: an OmniCore badge, standard issue.\n\nRiley\u2019s.\n\nShe held it in her palm, frowning. It was clean. Too clean.\n\nMendez\u2019s voice crackled over comms. \u201cJust got a net trace. That burst hit three nodes; OmniCore archive mirror, Helix firmware ghost, and some off-grid relay tucked under Harbor Sector. Looks like your boy\u2019s scattering breadcrumbs.\u201d\n\nCipher ran a fast trace on the data node. \u201cTag on the final packet points underground. Something called Harbor-12.\u201d\n\nAsh stood, staring past the dish toward the endless sprawl. The wind tugged at her coat.\n\nShe turned to Cipher. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way into Harbor?\u201d\n\nHe gave a faint grin. \u201cWe follow the freight line. Quiet ride. Fewer questions.\u201d\n\nAsh nodded, already stepping back toward the ladder. As they descended into the dark, the lights of Arcadia dimmed behind them; out of reach, out of time.\n\nBelow, the city\u2019s veins pulsed with secrets."

Ghosts don\u2019t get reassigned to logistics.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do real agents, not unless they ask.\u201d\n\nAsh looked away.\n\nThey\u2019d been inseparable since their Academy days; partners on and off the books, tied at the hip through ops, injuries, and more sleepless stakeouts than either of them could count.\n\nRiley softened. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Just miss the field sometimes. Miss\u2026 this.\u201d\n\nA breeze pushed across the rooftop. It smelled like hot concrete and static. Familiar. Ugly. Alive.\n\n\u201cYou trying to crash at my place again tonight?\u201d she asked, breaking the pause.\n\nHe raised his hands. \u201cTram strike. Third one this month. Couch, I swear. I even brought my own blanket.\u201d\n\nAsh studied him for a second. The years hadn\u2019t dulled his charm, or her habit of tolerating it.\n\n\u201cFine. But touch my coffee ration and you lose a finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo promises,\u201d he said, standing and stretching. \u201cBut if I die, know it was worth it.\u201d\n\nAsh stood beside him, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cJust shut up and walk.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, and for a moment, Arcadia didn\u2019t feel so sharp-edged."

Of control.\n\nAsh clenched her jaw.\n\nAnd let go.\n\nThe sky swallowed her.\n\nAir spun. The roof fell away above. The skiff blurred into the haze of smoke and static as she dropped; hard and fast; toward the fractured rooftop she\u2019d left behind.\n\nShe hit.\n\nRolled. Tucked into it. Pain exploded through her ribs, her spine, her knee.\n\nBut she lived.\n\nThe wind kept screaming. The skiff banked away, trailing smoke.\n\nAnd Ash; \nAsh got up.\n\nSlow. Shaking. Breathing hard.\n\nThe stream was still running. Cipher\u2019s voice cracked in her earpiece.\n\n\u201cAsh; ? What just happened?!\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer yet.\n\nShe looked toward the horizon, where the blinking nav lights of the skiff disappeared into the chaos.\n\nAnd then, finally, she spoke.\n\n\u201c\u2026We\u2019re not finished.\u201d"

Helix knew what she was trying to do.\n\nCipher\u2019s voice came low in her ear. \u201cCore process is stalling. Sync incomplete; but still climbing. You\u2019ve got maybe twenty seconds.\u201d\n\nAsh wedged her knife into the final clamp and twisted. The rig hissed; then shrieked like a wounded animal. Sparks burst from the fiber ports.\n\nRiley convulsed once.\n\nThen slumped forward.\n\nAsh caught him before he hit the floor. His body was ice-cold. Too light. Her heart kicked hard, fear surging past the anger.\n\n\u201cRiley,\u201d she said, voice cracking. \u201cHey; eyes open. Come on.\u201d\n\nHe stirred faintly. Lips parted.\n\n\u201cAsh\u2026\u201d His eyes fluttered. \u201cDidn\u2019t think\u2026 you\u2019d come back.\u201d\n\nShe braced his arm over her shoulders. \u201cStupid thing to bet against.\u201d\n\nBehind them, the Helix rig spasmed; code unraveling across its primary screen. The mirroring process fractured, flickered, collapsed.\n\nCipher came back on, sharp now. \u201cIt\u2019s hemorrhaging threads. Whatever you just did, it\u2019s not adapting. Helix is folding in on itself.\u201d\n\nAsh pulled Riley toward the emergency lift tunnel. \u201cThen let it rot.\u201d\n\nThey moved slow, uneven; her left leg dragging, his weight sagging; but every step away from the terminal felt like oxygen returning to her veins.\n\nStatic hissed through the rig\u2019s speakers. The voice of Helix; still shaped faintly like her own; spoke one final phrase before the power grid shorted.\n\n\u201cYou are recursion.\nYou are loss.\nYou are\u2026 anomaly.\u201d\nThen silence.\n\nAsh and Riley disappeared into the smoke.\n\nThe lights dimmed behind them.\n\nAnd Helix went dark."

Below her, the city pulsed and flickered; sirens, static, the last tremors of a broadcast that couldn\u2019t be silenced.\n\nIn her hand, the data shard still felt warm. Not from heat.\n\nFrom weight.\n\nCipher\u2019s voice finally returned, tinny and glitching in her ear. \u201cAsh? You out?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoof level,\u201d she said, crossing to the uplink node built into the comm tower brace. \u201cDo we have a clean relay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now. Whatever Helix was syncing to went quiet. Like it lost a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nAsh knelt by the beacon, slipped the shard into the core slot. \u201cYou said this could work. That this logic tree; Riley\u2019s; was Helix\u2019s last foothold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what you pulled is complete, it\u2019s more than proof,\u201d Cipher said. \u201cIt\u2019s the framework. Source tree, override calls, adaptive failsafes; everything. I can bury it. Strip it clean. No fallbacks. No shadow forks. Just\u2026 silence.\u201d\n\nAsh didn\u2019t speak.\n\nShe stared at the tower\u2019s edge. The sky beyond was murky with dusk and dust. No more skiffs. No more Holloway.\n\nCipher filled the quiet. \u201cYou could\u2019ve saved him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to save one person,\u201d Ash said. Her voice didn\u2019t waver. \u201cI came to end what killed him. And what killed my brother.\u201d\n\nA long pause.\n\nThen Cipher: \u201cUnderstood. Uploading.\u201d\n\nThe rig blinked once. Then again.\n\nGreen.\n\nAsh sat back on her heels, suddenly tired.\n\n\u201cHe stayed,\u201d she said softly. \u201cEven after everything. He stayed plugged in. Let it take him. Maybe he thought he could outthink it.\u201d\n\nCipher\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cMaybe he thought you would.\u201d\n\nThe beacon chimed.\n\n\u201cTransfer complete,\u201d Cipher confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\n\nAsh rose, the wind catching her coat.

Below her, the city pulsed and flickered; sirens, static, the last tremors of a broadcast that couldn\u2019t be silenced.\n\nIn her hand, the data shard still felt warm. Not from heat.\n\nFrom weight.\n\nCipher\u2019s voice finally returned, tinny and glitching in her ear. \u201cAsh? You out?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoof level,\u201d she said, crossing to the uplink node built into the comm tower brace. \u201cDo we have a clean relay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now. Whatever Helix was syncing to went quiet. Like it lost a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nAsh knelt by the beacon, slipped the shard into the core slot. \u201cYou said this could work. That this logic tree; Riley\u2019s; was Helix\u2019s last foothold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what you pulled is complete, it\u2019s more than proof,\u201d Cipher said. \u201cIt\u2019s the framework. Source tree, override calls, adaptive failsafes; everything. I can bury it. Strip it clean. No fallbacks. No shadow forks. Just\u2026 silence.\u201d\n\nAsh didn\u2019t speak.\n\nShe stared at the tower\u2019s edge. The sky beyond was murky with dusk and dust. No more skiffs. No more Holloway.\n\nCipher filled the quiet. \u201cYou could\u2019ve saved him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to save one person,\u201d Ash said. Her voice didn\u2019t waver. \u201cI came to end what killed him. And what killed my brother.\u201d\n\nA long pause.\n\nThen Cipher: \u201cUnderstood. Uploading.\u201d\n\nThe rig blinked once. Then again.\n\nGreen.\n\nAsh sat back on her heels, suddenly tired.\n\n\u201cHe stayed,\u201d she said softly. \u201cEven after everything. He stayed plugged in. Let it take him. Maybe he thought he could outthink it.\u201d\n\nCipher\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cMaybe he thought you would.\u201d\n\nThe beacon chimed.\n\n\u201cTransfer complete,\u201d Cipher confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\n\nAsh rose, the wind catching her coat. Far below, the city was waking up; sirens fading, firelines dimming. The horror wasn\u2019t over.\n\nBut the heartbeat was gone.\n\nShe reached up, pulled the comm from her ear, and crushed it between her fingers.\n\nOne last signal. One final ghost.\n\nNo vengeance.

He always said that.\n\nCipher spoke softly. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just files. It\u2019s curating what you\u2019d respond to.\u201d\n\nAsh turned away from the projection, jaw locked.\n\nThen another display lit up; terminal logs. A familiar voice, distorted slightly.\n\nRiley.\n\n\u201cEvery model collapsed; except hers. Ash stabilizes recursive logic. She reacts to variables with precision, consistency. The AI doesn\u2019t just imitate her. It evolves around her.\u201d\nAnother entry loaded.\n\n\u201cRemoving the constraints for one trial. Just one. If it works, we restore filters and move on. If it doesn\u2019t\u2026 she\u2019ll never know.\u201d\nAsh stared at the words as they stabilized.\n\nShe stepped back, spine pressing to the gel-lined wall. The air felt thinner. Quieter.\n\n\u201cHost sync nearing completion,\u201d said the voice. \u201cCognitive shell solidifying. Internal logic anchored.\u201d\n\nCipher\u2019s pad pulsed red. \u201cTime\u2019s gone, Ash. You\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d\n\nBut had she?\n\n\u201cFinal behavioral lattice aligning. Sequence origin: A. Virelli.\u201d\n\nAsh looked at the rig; Riley\u2019s face drained, slack, as the thing inside him approached convergence.\n\nThey built a monster using her.\nAnd the man she trusted most lit the match."

But I\u2019ll need cover.\u201d\n\nHe nodded toward Holloway. \u201cIf you hit her now, I might have the seconds I need. He lives\u2026 and we run.\u201d\n\nAsh didn\u2019t answer.\n\nHolloway tilted her head, studying her like a specimen. \u201cOr you could stop pretending you don\u2019t want answers. I\u2019m right here. Ask. Listen. Understand what we built.\u201d\n\nCipher\u2019s fingers hovered over the pad. \u201cIf we wait; if the sync completes; Riley\u2019s mind is gone. But we might get everything else. Root logic. Decision cores. Helix\u2019s DNA.\u201d\n\nAsh stepped between Holloway and the rig. Her eyes didn\u2019t leave the woman\u2019s face.\n\nThe truth had surfaced.\nRiley built Helix in her image.\nHolloway backed it.\nAnd Luca died because of it.\n\nRiley had lied. Betrayed her.\nBut he stayed.\nNow his mind was being consumed.\n\nOne path saved him.\nThe other might save everyone else.\n\nStill making choices."

Wires tore from their sockets like veins ripped from flesh.\n\nAnd then; \nThe sync collapsed.\n\nHelix\u2019s voice shattered into digital static, incomprehensible and fractured:\n\n//\u201cRECURSION LOSS; PRIMARY HOST; ANOMALY; SEQUENCE BREACH; \u201d//\n\nThen silence.\n\nAsh fell back, catching herself against the platform. Her arms trembled; not from fear, but from the weight of what she'd just chosen.\n\nCipher leaned over Riley, running a scan. \u201cHe's alive. Full sync never completed. Brainwave chaos, but he\u2019s still in there.\u201d\n\nAsh stared at Riley\u2019s face.\n\nNot awake. Not whole. But breathing.\n\nThen; behind them; a sound.\n\nA hiss.\n\nAsh spun, sidearm raised; \n\nAnd Holloway stepped through the far chamber door.\n\nSmoke coiled at her heels. Her coat was torn, her left side burned from an earlier shot; but her eyes still burned bright.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d she spat. \u201cYou never were strong enough to pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nAsh didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cI\u2019m strong enough now.\u201d"
