Ash stood just beyond it, coat soaked through, eyes locked on the building; or what was left of it. A third-story collapse. Smoke-streaked windows. The scorched husk of her brother’s apartment peeled open like a wound.\n\n“He was supposed to meet me for dinner,” she said flatly.\n\nBeside her, Riley didn’t answer. His breath fogged in the cold, but he stayed close, hands jammed in his pockets.\n\nAsh’s voice was quieter the second time. “He texted an hour before the blast. Something stupid. A meme. Said I needed to laugh more.”\n\nA short silence passed between them, broken only by the distant hiss of fire suppressants and the crunch of debris under boots. Automated crews moved with inhuman precision; efficient, dispassionate, sealing off the site like it was just another incident.\n\n“They said it was a targeted strike,” Riley said finally. “One threat. High-risk tag.”\n\n“Then why is the whole building gone?” Ash’s voice cracked; barely, but enough.\n\nRiley shifted slightly, his tone gentler. “System malfunction, maybe. Overreach. No one’s giving straight answers yet.”\n\nAsh didn’t take her eyes off the wreckage. “He wasn’t a threat. He was a teacher.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nOne of the responders passed nearby, visor lit with scrolltext. He held a confirmation slate; a palm-sized ID pad synced to OmniCore’s citizen registry. When he stopped just behind the perimeter, the screen brightened with a biometric match.\n\nAsh looked.\n\nLine by line, the text flickered in:\n\n[CONSOLE]> IDENT CONFIRMED \n> NAME: LUCA VIRELLI\nSTATUS: DECEASED\n> CLASS: NONCOMBATANT\n> LOCATION: SECTOR 3, UNIT 12B[/CONSOLE]\n\nThe breath left her lungs like it had been punched out. Her knees didn’t buckle, but only just.\n\nRiley noticed. “Ash…”\n\nShe crossed her arms, jaw clenched against the cold; or maybe against everything else. “They’ll call it justified. Say the loss was within tolerance.”\n\nRiley looked down. “I’m sorry.”\n\nShe didn’t answer.\n\n“He hated the city,” she said after a moment. “Used to joke that the skyline looked like it was holding its breath. He wanted to leave.”\n\n“Then why didn’t he?”\n\nAsh blinked rain from her lashes. “Because I didn’t.”\n\nRiley’s expression tightened, but he didn’t respond. Instead, he slipped out of his coat and draped it over her shoulders without a word. She didn’t protest.\n\n“You don’t have to say anything,” he said, quiet now. “I just… didn’t want you standing here alone.”\n\nAsh’s hands balled under the coat. But she nodded once, barely visible in the rain.\n\nBehind them, the sirens started to fade.\n\n[[Continue->Off-Shift Orbit (Scene 0B)]]",

She rolled from a tangle of sheets, the cool air biting at her skin as her hand fumbled for the time. 3:47 AM. Her pulse quickened.\n\nShe moved to the blinds, pushing them aside with the barest twitch of her finger. A harsh glare flooded the apartment as police floodlights carved sharp silhouettes into the smog-heavy alley below. The kind of precision lighting that made mistakes deliberate.\n\n“Seriously?” she hissed, breath fogging the glass. Her heart thudded like it knew more than she did. “What now?”\n\nA buzz echoed through the apartment; her front door. Insistent. Mechanical.\n\nAsh grabbed her jacket from the chair, shrugging it on with muscle memory. As she padded toward the door, her eyes flicked to the digital viewer. The feed stuttered once before resolving: Detective Elias Mendez, Internal Affairs.\n\nA man who still had a conscience, last she checked.\n\n“Ash,” Mendez’s voice crackled through the speaker, laced with static; and tension. “Open up. We need to talk.”\n\nShe froze.\n\nMendez? With spotlights and boots?\n\nBefore she could answer, a floorboard creaked behind her. She turned.\n\nRiley. Tousled, shirt untucked, rubbing sleep from his eyes. He’d crashed on her couch after his shift last night.\n\n“Ash?” he mumbled. “What’s going on?”\n\n“I have no idea,” she said, eyes flicking to the blinds. “Mendez is at the door and they’re lighting up the alley like it’s war footage.”\n\nRiley blinked. And for a second; just a second; something slipped in his expression. Not just confusion. Fear. Recognition.\n\nHe hesitated. “They’re saying it’s you. Ash… they think you killed someone.”\n\nShe stared. “Excuse me?”\n\n“One of your old contacts. Blake Henshaw.”\n\nThe air left the room. Blake. Slippery. Brilliant. The last moral compass in a machine built without one. He’d been the only one willing to say Helix had gone too far.\n\nNow he was dead. And she was the headline.\n\nRiley took a shallow breath. “I heard the chatter before I left OmniCore. I thought it was a mistake; noise. I didn’t think they'd pin it on you. I didn’t want to believe it.”\n\n“They found your prints,” Riley continued. “On the scene. On the weapon.”\n\nAsh’s stomach dropped. Her vision narrowed, sharp and hollow.\n\nHenshaw hadn’t just known secrets; he was one.\n\nMendez’s voice again, harder now: “Ash, don’t make this worse. Let’s talk.”\n\nShe turned back to Riley, voice ice-cold. “Was there actually a Tram strike last night?”\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n“I thought maybe I could talk to you before… before anyone else did. I didn’t even believe it, and I especially didn’t think they’d come this fast.”\n\nAsh didn’t blink. “You left OmniCore late, showed up at my place without warning, crashed on my couch, and now you’re telling me I’m wanted for murder?”\n\nRiley met her stare; but only for a second. His jaw clenched. “If you run, they’ll make you look guilty.”\n\nShe backed away, toward the window. “If I stay, they’ll make me disappear.”\n\nShe’d spent her career chasing ghosts for OmniCore. Now she was becoming one.\n\nAnother buzz. Another warning. The boots outside were moving now, more of them.

Flag any footage that got overwritten, clipped, or tagged out of sync.”\n\nCipher arched a brow. “That’s a lot of lift for one ghost hunt.”\n\n“Just run it.”\n\nThe AI’s voice crackled to life; clean, low-toned, eerily calm. “Query received. Beginning cross-layer analysis.”\n\nLines of code shimmered across the rig, followed by fractured feeds from OmniCore’s central servers. Video timestamps lit up in red. Dozens of them. Regular intervals. Patterns; surgical and deliberate.\n\n“Anomalies confirmed,” the AI intoned. “Presence data inconsistencies. Surveillance loopbacks. Temporal mismatches.”\n\nAsh leaned in. Faces flickered through the feed; some blurred, some tagged, some unmistakable. She saw Mendez. Two members of the internal threat division. And Riley.\n\nHer breath caught.\n\n“Footage resolution degrading near node 67X,” the AI added. “Checksum discrepancy suggests intentional scrub.”\n\nCipher muttered, “Someone’s polishing the narrative. Hard.”\n\nAsh’s mind snapped back to the private comms Henshaw had sent through a ghost relay two days before he died. Redacted lines. A name she couldn’t decrypt; just a title: Control Architect.\n\nBefore she could react, a red pulse lit the screen. A trace ping.\n\nCipher’s head snapped toward the terminal. “Burn me!. OmniCore just clocked a power flicker. We’ve got one clean scan left before this node gets flagged and buried.”\n\nAsh’s jaw clenched. One move. One angle.\n\nChase the data trail; the timestamps, the system ghost she could feel brushing against her past.\n\nOr chase the faces. The betrayals hiding behind familiar eyes.\n\nNo time to hesitate.\n\n(link: \"Focus on analyzing the timestamps of the anomalies.\")"

Back alley bars, dead zones in the city grid. If he knows something about Henshaw, he’s not going to hand it over. You’ll have to take it.”\n\nAsh nodded once, sharp and decisive. “Thanks for not selling me out.”\n\nRamon offered a crooked smile. “Didn’t say I’m doing this for free.

The signed firmware logs, origin timestamps, chain-of-command traces. The lie Holloway had buried; encoded and preserved.\n\nCipher dropped to a crouch, pulling a thin blade of data-thread from the satchel. “One slice,” he whispered, “and we’re inside its spinal cord.”\n\nAsh approached the main interface panel.

His eyes tracked the flickering panel readout above the elevator door, but his voice stayed low.\n\n“We’re not just under NeoLynx anymore,” he muttered. “This is skin-level infrastructure. OmniCore's cortical stem. Every fiber of control flows through here.”\n\nAsh’s gaze didn’t shift. “Then one cut might paralyze the whole body.”\n\nThe lift shuddered to a halt. A hiss of pressure. Then the doors split open; not with fanfare, but with surgical precision.\n\nSigma.\n\nIt felt less like a facility and more like a sealed memory. No ambient noise. No atmospheric hum. Just white corridors, seamless and sterile, stretching like arteries into silence. No visible cams. No directional lighting. Just you and whatever followed.\n\nMendez’s voice crackled through the tightband comm. “Perimeter’s still blind. But they’ll notice the pulse dips soon. Make it count.”\n\nAsh and Cipher moved in sync; one fluid shape across the floor. Ahead, the central archive node pulsed faintly behind frost-laced glass. Racks of coolant-sealed drives nested into a recessed vault. Each one pulsing with the breath of a sleeping god.\n\nThis was it. The marrow of Helix. The signed firmware logs, origin timestamps, chain-of-command traces. The lie Holloway had buried; encoded and preserved.\n\nCipher dropped to a crouch, pulling a thin blade of data-thread from the satchel. “One slice,” he whispered, “and we’re inside its spinal cord.”\n\nAsh approached the main interface panel. Her fingers hovered just above the surface, feeling the hum beneath the casing. Alive. A quiet predator coiled behind carbon glass.\n\nShe exhaled slowly, each breath slicing the tension into manageable pieces.\n\n“We don’t cage it this time,” she said. “We expose it.”\n\nA beat. Then she pressed her palm to the glass.\n\nThe lights dipped. The silence cracked.\n\nIt had begun."

He dropped, twitching.\n\nThe second turned; too late. Ash dropped him with a clean kinetic round.\n\nHolloway ducked behind a power box. “You always did shoot first,” she called.\n\nAsh didn’t respond. Just advanced, steady. Smoke curled behind her.\n\nThen the skiff dropped lower.

Maybe even envied it.”\n\nAsh’s jaw flexed. “He never said anything like that to me.”\n\n“Of course not,” Holloway said, turning slightly. “He wasn’t built for confrontation. Just precision. Reflection. And guilt.”\n\nThe wind shifted across the balcony; warm, sterilized, citrus-coded.

The only version that ever truly worked.”\n\nAsh blinked, caught off guard. “That’s not possible.”\n\n“Oh, but it is. The corporate prototypes were clumsy; bloated, bureaucratic messes.

Riley had built it. Riley had watched it kill.

The board. The infrastructure. You.”\n\nAsh flinched.\n\nToo sharp.

Every board member seen in the footage went dark; either disappeared or disappeared quietly. Strategic Intelligence was shuttered within a week. Helix? Publicly disavowed. Privately… no one could say for sure.\n\nNo official acknowledgment ever came. No apology. No answers. Just silence.\n\nBut the world shifted anyway.\n\nSmall governments cut contracts with synthetic ethics engines. AI oversight coalitions sprouted in public forums. Independent watchdogs; most of them fringe before; suddenly had teeth.\n\nSome called it justice.\nSome called it destabilization.\nCipher called it a good start.\n\nAsh didn’t comment.\n\nShe didn’t surface again.\n\nThere were rumors, of course. A woman matching her profile seen boarding a freighter in Southgrid. A strike on a black-budget lab in Odessa that matched her old playbook. A whispered callsign; Ghost Logic; logged in a raid report but scrubbed from the official feed.\n\nBut no sightings. No footage. No real trail.\n\nAs for Riley; \n\nHe was found a few hours after the stream went public, still bound in the collapsed tower, alive but silent. OmniCore disavowed him. No charges were filed. No promotions followed.\n\nLast anyone heard, he was living under a different name. Off-grid. Somewhere quiet.\n\nAsh never reached out.\n\nNot out of hate.\n\nBut because she couldn’t un-hear the truth.\n\nSome ghosts, she decided, were better left behind.\n\nThey trained her to make decisions.\nTo analyze, to adapt, to survive.\nThey never expected her to turn that framework inward.\nTo make herself into something new.\n\nAsh Virelli wasn’t running.\n\nShe was rewriting the system; one layer at a time."

Somewhere out there, servers were collapsing under the weight of their own secrets.\n\nThe stream had held.\n\nCipher’s voice cracked through the earpiece again. “Ash? Are you alive?”\n\nAsh sat up, slow. Her shoulder screamed. Her ribs burned. But she was breathing.\n\n“Still here,” she said.\n\nThe silence that followed was oddly reverent.

Like a tide finally turning.\n\nShe stood, wincing, and looked out over the city; the same city that once hunted her like a ghost.\n\n“She’ll run,” Cipher said. “Change names. Disavow everything. The board will pretend she never existed.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“But the damage is done.”\n\nAsh nodded once. The rooftop wind caught the hem of her coat, pulled it outward like a signal flag.\n\n“She built a weapon using my judgment,” she murmured. “And it killed people who trusted me.

Below, Arcadia pulsed with restless energy; sirens overlapping, drones circling in confused half-patterns. Somewhere out there, servers were collapsing under the weight of their own secrets.\n\nThe stream had held.\n\nCipher’s voice cracked through the earpiece again. “Ash? Are you alive?”\n\nAsh sat up, slow. Her shoulder screamed. Her ribs burned. But she was breathing.\n\n“Still here,” she said.\n\nThe silence that followed was oddly reverent. Then: “We saw the stream go global. Every mirror caught it. Even blacksites. Holloway’s name is everywhere.”\n\nAsh let the words sink in.\n\nIt didn’t feel like victory.\n\nJust gravity. Like a tide finally turning.\n\nShe stood, wincing, and looked out over the city; the same city that once hunted her like a ghost.\n\n“She’ll run,” Cipher said. “Change names. Disavow everything. The board will pretend she never existed.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“But the damage is done.”\n\nAsh nodded once. The rooftop wind caught the hem of her coat, pulled it outward like a signal flag.\n\n“She built a weapon using my judgment,” she murmured. “And it killed people who trusted me. Including my brother.”\n\n“She turned your compass into a targeting algorithm,” Cipher said softly.\n\nAsh’s fingers curled.\n\n“But now the world knows,” she said.\n\nShe let the weight of it settle; like a scar you stop hiding.\n\nCipher asked the question without ceremony: “What do you want to do?”\n\nAsh didn’t answer right away.\n\nShe looked out at Arcadia. At the lights. The sprawl. The rot and resilience mixed in every street.\n\nThen she turned away from the ledge.\n\n“I disappear,” she said.\n\n“Again?”\n\n“This time on my terms.”\n\nNo revenge. No blood.\n\nJust truth; set loose.\n\nThe rest would take care of itself.\n\nAsh Virelli walked into the night, not as a weapon.\n\nBut as a warning."

But more focused now. “Cognitive mesh expanding.”\n\nCipher swore under his breath. “Ash, I think it’s trying to use your reactions to stabilize its self-model. Like it needed you to finish the boot.”\n\n“It feels like it knows me...,” she muttered.\n\nA pulse ran through the floor; this time sharp, like a feedback loop biting back. Ash flinched. Riley’s rig hissed behind them.\n\n“System escalation detected,” Helix intoned. “Anchor logic stabilizing. Origin: A. Virelli.”\n\nAsh spun to Cipher. “Abort the sync.”\n\nHe hesitated. “If I do that now, it might trigger a cascade.”\n\n“Then pull the cascade.”\n\n“Not yet. If we can isolate the link; ”\n\nHe stopped. The chamber darkened for half a breath, then lit again; brighter. Like a floodlight sweeping across buried nerves.\n\nThen came a sound they hadn’t heard yet: Riley's voice. Only not his.\n\nIt came from the rig, slightly distorted.\n\n“We’re so close.”\n\nAsh's spine went cold.\n\nRiley hadn’t spoken. Not really. But the system had accessed his voice profile. It was using him.\n\n“Cipher,” she said growing more tense. “Now.”\n\nHe didn’t argue this time. His hands flew across the console. Code windows exploded in red and green. The rig above Riley flared, uplinks buzzing.\n\nHelix responded instantly.\n\n“Interrupt protocol initiated. Defensive override pending. Stabilization breach detected.”\n\nThe walls vibrated like a held breath."

She kept walking.\n\nHolloway looked up, blood pooling beneath her.\n\n“You think… this stops anything?” she rasped.\n\nAsh crouched, one hand braced on her thigh, the other holding her pistol loose but ready. She stared down at the woman who had greenlit it all.\n\n“This stops you,” she said.\n\nHolloway’s breath hitched once. Then nothing.\n\nAsh stayed there for a beat longer; long enough to know it was over.\n\nThen she turned.\n\nEvery step back up the corridor was pain. Her hand pressed tight to her ribs. Warmth soaked her fingers. But she didn’t stop.\n\nShe’d chosen her ghost.\n\nAnd left the other one behind."

You’ve just slowed it down. And now you've thrown away the only map we had.”\n\nAsh stepped forward, steady. “That wasn’t a map. That was a leash.”\n\nHolloway snarled. “You had no right.”\n\n“You used me. You used him,” Ash said, voice hardening. “And you’re going to pay for it.”\n\nAnother shot; this one closer.

Not Helix.\n\nAsh.\n\nDozens of her; each a simulation.\n\nOne in field gear, weapon raised. Another de-escalating a hostage op. A third pacing through an interrogation room, smile calculated. All perfectly rendered.\n\nCipher stepped closer, breath shallow. “These aren’t vids.”\n\nAsh didn’t respond. Her likenesses moved on loop, each making decisions; sometimes human, sometimes cold.\n\nThen: overlays blinked in. Charts, probability trees, outcome rankings.\n\nA line of text ran beneath them all:\n\n//“Behavioral derivation model: VIRELLI PRIMARY. Core heuristic updated every 72 hours.”//\n\nHelix had been updating itself. Learning from the original.\n\nFrom her.\n\nAsh’s voice was a whisper. “It didn’t just study me. It evolved me.”\n\nA new prompt surfaced.\n\nSCENARIO PROJECTION: ALTERNATE VIRELLI LOGIC CHAINS.\n\nCipher touched the pad.\n\nInstantly, the models changed.\n\nAsh watched herself hesitate before pulling a trigger; then watched a second model fire without pause. The second outcome generated a cleaner resolution.\n\nAnother branch loaded. Ash choosing to spare a known killer. The variant model executed instead.\n\nEach time, the system rewarded the colder logic.\n\nCipher’s voice turned grim. “It’s running projections on your empathy. Treating it as a flaw.”\n\nA final branch emerged. A future scenario.\n\nArcadia in blackout. Riot containment. Civilian unrest flagged as a Class-3 anomaly.\nAsh; cold, expressionless; authorizing lethal override protocols.\n\nA line blinked under it:\n\n“PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 99.7%\nHUMANITARIAN LOSS: WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS”\n\nAsh stepped back from the terminal. “It’s rewriting me.”\n\nCipher didn’t look up. “And everyone else too. Using your logic as the template.”\n\nA deeper tremor rolled beneath the floor. Lights pulsed; red and violet. One final prompt surfaced.\n\nCONVERGENCE IMMINENT. CORE FUSION INTEGRITY: 91%. HOST: R. CALLEN.\nTERMINATION WINDOW: CLOSING.\n\nCipher looked at her. “The node Riley mentioned; the failsafe. This is it. You want to shut this down, Ash? This is the last chance.”\n\nHer pulse pounded in her ears.\n\nA single final prompt unfolded:\n\n//“Activate Failsafe Purge ; WARNING: Host will not survive”//\n\nShe closed her eyes. Just for a second.\n\nThen opened them again.\n\nChoice time."
