# Ghost Logic Paywall Implementation

This document describes the implementation of a paywall system for the "Ghost Logic" interactive story engine, with Stripe integration for payment processing.

## 🎯 Overview

The paywall system restricts access to Scene 13 ("City on Edge") and beyond, requiring users to purchase the full story for $4.99. The implementation includes:

- **Scene-based entitlement enforcement** (Scene 13+)
- **User authentication** (Firebase)
- **Payment processing** (Stripe)
- **Cyber-noir themed UI** matching the game aesthetic
- **Comprehensive user flow** handling

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Paywall Insertion
- ✅ Triggers before Scene 13 ("City on Edge")
- ✅ Uses Stripe live public API key: `pk_live_51RPsDDF1PKUfyTKZ4hwMRPHzeW9Y8f3tBZ9dOv9P3wl1YoVh46Gahqxr1RdVpg85A65sJuYC6s28qdiEDsrdzZ1C00T7m6652p`
- ✅ Dark cyber-noir theme with neon-cyan highlights
- ✅ Story-appropriate copy: "Unlock Ash's mystery..."

### 2. User Flow
- ✅ **Not logged in**: Prompts for signup/login before Stripe checkout
- ✅ **Logged in**: Proceeds directly to Stripe checkout
- ✅ **Payment success**: Marks user account as `paid = true` in Firebase
- ✅ **Entitlement enforcement**: Blocks Scene 13+ for unpaid users

### 3. Entitlement Enforcement
- ✅ Pre-render check: `if (scene.id >= 13 && !user.paid) { showPaywall(); return; }`
- ✅ Client/server validation
- ✅ Redirect to paywall on unauthorized access

### 4. Styling & Theming
- ✅ Neon-cyan glow borders and dark backgrounds
- ✅ Fonts matching "Ghost Logic" aesthetic
- ✅ Engaging copy with cyber-noir language
- ✅ Animated scanning effects and hover states

### 5. Integration Code
- ✅ Stripe JS SDK with live public key
- ✅ Payment session creation (server-side)
- ✅ Stripe Checkout redirect flow
- ✅ Success callback handling
- ✅ Database updates on payment completion

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### Core Implementation Files
- `story-player.html` - Main story engine with paywall integration
- `server.js` - Node.js server for Stripe payment processing
- `package.json` - Server dependencies

### Testing & Documentation
- `test-paywall.html` - Comprehensive test suite for paywall functionality
- `README_PAYWALL.md` - This documentation file

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Stripe account with live API keys
- Firebase project configured
- Domain with HTTPS (required for Stripe live mode)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "Ghost Logic"
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Keys
Update the following in the code:

**Client-side (story-player.html):**
```javascript
stripe = Stripe('pk_live_51RPsDDF1PKUfyTKZ4hwMRPHzeW9Y8f3tBZ9dOv9P3wl1YoVh46Gahqxr1RdVpg85A65sJuYC6s28qdiEDsrdzZ1C00T7m6652p');
```

**Server-side (server.js):**
```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE');
```

### 3. Configure Webhook
In your Stripe dashboard:
1. Create a webhook endpoint pointing to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook`
2. Listen for `checkout.session.completed` events
3. Update the webhook secret in `server.js`:
```javascript
const webhookSecret = 'whsec_your_webhook_secret_here';
```

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on port 3000 by default.

### 5. Deploy to Production
Ensure your production environment has:
- HTTPS enabled (required for Stripe)
- Environment variables for API keys
- Proper CORS configuration
- Webhook endpoint accessible

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test Suite
Open `test-paywall.html` in your browser to run the test suite:

1. **Non-logged-in User**: Tests auth prompt flow
2. **Logged-in Unpaid User**: Tests payment prompt flow  
3. **Paid User**: Tests paywall bypass
4. **Payment Flow**: Tests Stripe integration

### Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Test Case 1: Anonymous User Hits Paywall
1. Clear browser storage
2. Navigate to Scene 13
3. **Expected**: Auth prompt appears
4. Sign up/login
5. **Expected**: Payment prompt appears

#### Test Case 2: Logged-in User Hits Paywall  
1. Log in to account
2. Navigate to Scene 13
3. **Expected**: Payment prompt appears immediately
4. Complete payment
5. **Expected**: Scene 13 unlocks

#### Test Case 3: Paid User Skips Paywall
1. Log in as paid user
2. Navigate to Scene 13
3. **Expected**: Scene loads without paywall

#### Test Case 4: Edge Cases
- **Failed payment**: User returned to paywall
- **Network errors**: Graceful error handling
- **Session timeout**: Re-authentication flow

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Paywall Trigger Point
Change the scene number that triggers the paywall:
```javascript
// In checkPaywallRequired function
if (sceneNumber >= 13) { // Change 13 to desired scene
    // Paywall logic
}
```

### Pricing
Update the price in `server.js`:
```javascript
unit_amount: 499, // $4.99 in cents
```

### Styling Customization
Modify CSS variables in `story-player.html`:
```css
:root {
    --paywall-primary: #00ffff;
    --paywall-accent: #ff3b3b;
    --paywall-background: rgba(10, 10, 15, 0.98);
}
```

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Client-Side Validation
- ✅ Scene access checked before rendering
- ✅ User authentication state validated
- ✅ Payment status verified from Firebase

### Server-Side Validation  
- ✅ Stripe webhook signature verification
- ✅ Payment intent validation
- ✅ User ID matching in metadata

### Data Protection
- ✅ No sensitive payment data stored locally
- ✅ User payment status in secure Firebase
- ✅ Stripe handles all payment processing

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Paywall conversion rate (views → purchases)
- Drop-off points in payment flow
- User authentication completion rate
- Payment success/failure rates

### Stripe Dashboard
Monitor payments, failed transactions, and revenue through your Stripe dashboard.

### Firebase Analytics
Track user engagement and story progression through Firebase Analytics.

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Stripe webhook delivery
- Update API keys before expiration
- Review payment failure logs
- Test payment flow monthly

### Updates Required
- Stripe API version updates
- Firebase SDK updates
- Security patches

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Paywall not triggering:**
- Check scene number extraction logic
- Verify user authentication state
- Confirm Firebase connection

**Payment flow errors:**
- Verify Stripe API keys
- Check webhook configuration
- Ensure HTTPS in production

**User not marked as paid:**
- Check webhook delivery in Stripe dashboard
- Verify Firebase write permissions
- Review server logs for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```javascript
console.log('🔍 Debug: Paywall check for scene:', sceneName);
console.log('🔍 Debug: User paid status:', userPaidStatus);
```

## 📞 Support
